# Warehouse tools

Small Python utilities for warehouse order and shipping workflows.

Run the tests with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.

## Shipping

`shipping_quote(weight_kg, zone, service="standard")` returns a delivery quote in
dollars, rounded to two decimal places. Zones are `local` and `regional`; weights
must be positive. Standard shipping costs $5 for local or $8 for regional, plus
$1.50 per kilogram. Express shipping adds a flat $7 to either zone's standard
rate. Omitting `service` preserves standard pricing. Unknown services or zones
and non-positive weights raise `ValueError`.

```python
from warehouse.rates import shipping_quote

shipping_quote(2, "local")                     # 8.0 (standard)
shipping_quote(2, "local", service="express")  # 15.0
```

The command-line entry point prints a quote for an order. `--service` accepts
`standard` (the default) or `express`; unknown services are rejected.

```console
$ python3 -m warehouse.cli 2 regional
$11.00
$ python3 -m warehouse.cli 2 regional --service express
$18.00
```
